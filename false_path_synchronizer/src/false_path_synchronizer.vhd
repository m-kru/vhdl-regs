-- False_Path_Synchronizer is the Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)
-- synchronizer with set false path.

-- Setting false path on CDC is not recommmended, as it does not guarantee
-- coherency between signals. However, if you consciously do not care about
-- the latency and coherency, setting false path can be really useful as it
-- loosens the constraints for Place & Route algorithms.
